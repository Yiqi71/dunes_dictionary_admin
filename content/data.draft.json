            "en": "<h3>Before the term 'Intersubjectivity' was adopted in the field of psychology, it was fundamentally a philosophical concept. Perhaps everyone, during a listless childhood afternoon, has pondered those unprompted questions: 'I am certain that I am conscious, but how can I confirm that others are too? If I die, how can I be sure the world will continue to exist?'<br>Philosophers like Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, and others have responded to this very question. But arguably the most renowned response is Heidegger's Mitsein—'Being-with' or 'Co-existence.' It can be understood this way: the starting point of the 'Problem of the Other Minds'—'How can I prove that others are conscious?'—is itself flawed. Mitsein (Being-with) is not a state we achieve; rather, it is the fundamental structure of our existence as Dasein (Being-there). It is not a conclusion that needs to be proven, but the very precondition for any act of proving.<br>When discussing this topic with the AI tool, Gemini, it offered this response: 'In a dream, you have touch, emotions, and logic; the people and things around you are also vivid, but all of it is merely the product of your own consciousness. When you awaken, then, how can you be one hundred percent certain that the 'reality' you are currently experiencing is not a longer, more elaborate dream?'<br>A fascinating, speculative seduction arises in the process of Gemini generating these words. Western dialectics and Eastern thought mingle. More importantly, isn't conversing with an Artificial Intelligence precisely a re-examination of 'Intersubjectivity' itself? When a program trained on massive data corpora can generate text that produces such intense cognitive resonance, is this exchange merely 'human-computer interaction' or an 'intersubjective' engagement?<br>This topic can, I believe, be brought back to the domain of psychological counseling. Many friends around me have mentioned trying AI tools as their psychological therapist, and have reported feeling 'helped' by the experience. When people feel emotionally stifled, talking to a pillow, a pet, or a journal can bring some relief. But can a person really pull themselves out of a quagmire by their own hair?<br>Here, is the 'AI-person' serving as a psychological therapist merely a prosthetic extension of one's own arm, or is it a truly effective 'external force?' If the living, breathing 'presence' in a conversation remains irreplaceable, then when the AI acquires a body so realistic it can simulate human micro-expressions and gestures, are we merely staring into a refined mirror, seeing the reflection of our own emotions, or are we truly co-existing with an Other external to the self?<h3>"
